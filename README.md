<h2>Python AdHoc Pivot Table</h2>
<h3>Main Script</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Script utilizes Pandas library to operate on the datasets.</li>
  <li>Data input: csv files.</li>
  <li>Script groups the data by the company name (3 of them) and sums up the count of the lines occurance in the file.</li>
  <li>Script helps out either with ad-hoc queries or with monthly based KPI report.</li>
  <li>Time of script's work lasts 3-4 sec. whereas preparing pivots manually with excel lasts about 5 min (depending on user)</li>
  <li>The need of preparing these figures even couple of times a day saves a lot of time in terms of weeks or months.</li>
  <li>This is a good example of saving time with automated data processing.</li>
  <li>Implementing automation in data processing brings also data quality and eliminates risk of human's erros or oversights.</li>
